In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring heat. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor.Heat is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faranheit” and used the SimuleIDE Software.Mostly it is used in vehicles to make sure that the equipments used are working efficiently in cold weather.It takes an analog input and generates a temperature accordingly via master slave communication.It is a low Cost one . It checks if the driver is seated or not and it Can modify the temperature according to the passenger.
